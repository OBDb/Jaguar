## About Jaguar

Jaguar is a British luxury vehicle manufacturer with a rich history of producing elegant, high-performance automobiles. Founded in 1922 as the Swallow Sidecar Company by Sir William Lyons, the company has evolved into one of the world's most recognizable luxury automotive brands.

## Generations

### Early Years (1922-1945)

Originally established as the Swallow Sidecar Company by William Lyons and William Walmsley, the company initially produced motorcycle sidecars before expanding into automobile bodies. In 1935, the company launched its first car under the Jaguar name, the SS Jaguar 2.5L Saloon. During World War II, production shifted to support the war effort.

### Post-War Expansion (1945-1968)

After the war, the company officially changed its name to Jaguar Cars Ltd. This era saw the introduction of iconic models like the XK120, XK140, and XK150 sports cars, as well as the legendary E-Type in 1961, widely regarded as one of the most beautiful cars ever made. The Mark VII, Mark VIII, and Mark IX luxury saloons established Jaguar's reputation for combining performance with luxury.

### British Leyland Era (1968-1984)

In 1968, Jaguar merged with the British Motor Corporation (BMC) to form British Leyland. This period was challenging for the brand, marked by quality issues and industrial disputes. Despite these challenges, Jaguar launched the XJ6, which would become the backbone of the company's sedan lineup for decades.

### Independence and Ford Ownership (1984-2008)

Jaguar was privatized in 1984 and subsequently acquired by Ford in 1989, becoming part of Ford's Premier Automotive Group. Under Ford's ownership, Jaguar expanded its lineup with models like the S-Type, X-Type, and a new generation of XJ saloons. This period saw significant investment in modernizing Jaguar's manufacturing facilities and product development.

### Tata Motors Era (2008-Present)

In 2008, Tata Motors of India acquired Jaguar along with Land Rover from Ford. Under Tata's ownership, Jaguar has experienced a renaissance, introducing critically acclaimed models such as the XF, XE, F-Type sports car, and the all-electric I-PACE SUV. The company has also made commitments to electrification, announcing plans to become an all-electric luxury brand in the future.
